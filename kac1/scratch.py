    This utility function uses no arguments, but can contain anything that needs to be tested and the function will be timed automatically, below.

# ======================== TIMEIT: DO NOT DELETE ========================
# set num to the number of times you want to run scratch(); NOTE: print statments will print in the terminal num times!
num = 1000000
t1 = timeit.Timer("scratch()", "from __main__ import scratch")
# the printed number gives the total time; so time using num=10 will be ten times longer than num=1 unless you divide t1 by 10; using large numbers for num increases overhead time, apparently
t = t1.timeit(number=num)
print('\nscratch ran ', num, ' times in: ',
      '{0:0.6f}'.format(t), " sec", sep='')
print('\nscratch ran once on average in: ',
      '{0:0.6f}'.format(t/num*1000000), ' microsec', sep='')

Note: Pay attention to the fact that the output is the execution time of number times iteration of the code snippet, not the single iteration. For a single iteration exec. time, divide the output time by number.
